1. Introduction : 
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for the classification of Iris flowers. The logistic regression model is utilized for this task.

2. Data Preprocessing : 
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file ('Iris.csv'), unnecessary columns are removed, and column names are renamed for better clarity. Additionally, any missing values are checked and handled appropriately.

3. Data Visualization :
Summary statistics and visualizations, such as pair plots and histograms, are provided to gain insights into the distribution of the data and relationships between different features.

4. Model Building :
A logistic regression model is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data.

5. Evaluating the Model : 
The trained model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy score and classification report, to assess its performance on the testing set.

6. User Input and Classification
The project includes functionality for users to input values for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The trained model is then used to predict the Iris species based on the provided input.
